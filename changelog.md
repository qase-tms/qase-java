# qase-java 4.0.3

## What's new

Implemented support for running only the tests included in a test plan.  
To enable this feature, specify the test plan ID in the reporter configuration.  
You can set it either in the `qase.config.json` file or through the `QASE_TESTOPS_PLAN_ID` environment variable.
